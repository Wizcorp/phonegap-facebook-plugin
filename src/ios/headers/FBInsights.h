 @class FBInsights
 
 @abstract
 Client-side event logging for specialized application analytics available through Facebook Insights 
 and Conversion Pixel conversion tracking for ads optimization.
 
 @discussion
 The `FBInsights` static class has a few related roles:
 
 + Logging predefined events to Facebook Application Insights with a
 numeric value to sum across a large number of events, and an optional set of key/value
 parameters that define "segments" for this event (e.g., 'purchaserStatus' : 'frequent', or
 'gamerLevel' : 'intermediate')
 
 + Logging 'purchase' events to later be used for ads optimization around lifetime value.
 
 + Logging 'conversion pixels' for use in ads conversion tracking and optimization.
 
 + Methods that control the way in which events are flushed out to the Facebook servers.
 
 Here are some important characteristics of the logging mechanism provided by `FBInsights`:
 
 + Events are not sent immediately when logged.  They're cached and flushed out to the Facebook servers
   in a number of situations:
   - when an event count threshold is passed.
   - when a time threshold is passed.
   - when an app has gone to background and is then brought back to the foreground.
 
 + Events will be accumulated when the app is in a disconnected state, and sent when the connection is
   restored and one of the above 'flush' conditions are met.
 
 + The `FBInsights` class in thread-safe in that events may be logged from any of the app's threads.
 
 Some things to note when logging events:
 
 + There is a limit to the number of unique parameter names in the provided parameters that can
 be used per event, on the order of 10.  This is not just for an individual call, but for all
 invocations for that eventName.
 + Event names and parameter names (the keys in the NSDictionary) must be between 2 and 40 characters
 + The length of each parameter value can be no more than on the order of 100 characters.
 + When logging events, the "client token" must be set.  An exception will be thrown if it isn't.  See
   [FBSettings setClientToken] for more information.
