 @class 
 
 @abstract
 Represents the data needed by an FBFriendPickerViewController, in order to construct
 the necessary request to populate the view; instances of FBFriendPickerCacheDescriptor
 are used to fetch data ahead of the point when the data is used to populate a display.
 
 @discussion
 A common use of an FBFriendPickerCacheDescriptor instance, is to allocate an instance
 at the point when a session is opened, and then call prefetchAndCacheForSession. This 
 causes the API to fetch and cache the data needed by the FBFriendPickerViewController.
 If at some point the user goes to select friends, the FBFriendPickerViewController
 will first check the cache for a copy of the friends list, and then after displaying
 whatever cached data is available, then it will fetch a fresh copy of the friends list.
