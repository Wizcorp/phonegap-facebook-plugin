# Facebook Requirements and Set-Up [iOS]

To use this plugin you will need to make sure you've registered your Facebook app with Facebook and have an `APP_ID` [https://developers.facebook.com/apps](https://developers.facebook.com/apps).

If you plan on rolling this out on iOS, please note that you will need to ensure that you have properly set up your Native iOS App settings on the [Facebook App Dashboard](http://developers.facebook.com/apps). Please see the [Getting Started with the Facebook SDK](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started/): Create a Facebook App section, for more details on this.
