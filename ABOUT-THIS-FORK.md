We used to pull updates from https://github.com/Wizcorp/phonegap-facebook-plugin but
while the GitHub upstream is still that repo we're now actually pulling from
https://github.com/jeduan/cordova-plugin-facebook4 since the former is unmaintained.

Why not change the GitHub upstream then? Well, if you know why please open an issue and tell me how :)
