# Facebook Requirements and Set-Up [Android]

To use this plugin you will need to make sure you've registered your Facebook app with Facebook and have an APP_ID (https://developers.facebook.com/apps).

If you plan on rolling this out on Android, please note that you will need to [generate a hash of your Android key(s) and submit those to the Developers page on Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/android/getting-started/facebook-sdk-for-android/) to get it working. Furthermore, if you are generating this hash on Windows (specifically 64 bit versions), please use version 0.9.8e or 0.9.8d of [OpenSSL for Windows](http://code.google.com/p/openssl-for-windows/downloads/list) and *not* 0.9.8k. Big ups to [fernandomatos](http://github.com/fernandomatos) for pointing this out!

## Example Apps

`platforms/android` and `platforms/ios` contain example projects and all the native code for the plugin for both Android and iOS platforms. They also include versions of the Android and iOS Facebook SDKs. These are used during automatic installation.

For Android sample app remember to configure the project with your FB app id in the `res/values/facebookconnect.xml` file. For example:

	<resources>
		<string name="fb_app_id">123456789</string>
		<string name="fb_app_name">TEST</string>
	</resources>

## Install

This plugin requires [Cordova CLI](http://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/3.5.0/guide_cli_index.md.html).

To install the plugin in your app, execute the following (replace variables where necessary):
```sh
# Create initial Cordova app
$ cordova create myApp
$ cd myApp/
$ cordova platform add android

# Remember to replace APP_ID and APP_NAME variables
$ cordova -d plugin add /path/to/cloned/phonegap-facebook-plugin --variable APP_ID="123456789" --variable APP_NAME="myApplication"
```

## Java 7

The latest Facebook SDK requires Java 7 (or higher), which does not come installed on OS X.  To use this plugin you will need to [install the Java 7 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) and add it to your environment.  You should also add the following to the custom_rules.xml file of your Cordova project if building with Ant:

	<property name="java.target" value="1.7" />
	<property name="java.source" value="1.7" />

If you use Gradle to build your project, modify the compileOptions block in build.gradle to the following:

	compileOptions {
		sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7
		targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_7
	}

## Quirks

The FacebookSDK needs to be initialized once in the `onCreate` method of your application class using the `initializeFacebookSdkWithApplication` method.

If you donâ€™t have an application class (which is most likely the case for a Cordova app), you can create one using this template:

```java
package my.package.namespace;

import android.app.Application;
import org.apache.cordova.facebook.ConnectPlugin;

public class App extends Application {

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        ConnectPlugin.initializeFacebookSdkWithApplication(this);
    }

}
```

And add your application name to `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<application android:name="my.package.namespace.App" ... >...</application>
```


## Setup with Eclipse (Removed)

** You no longer need the additional Eclipse steps.  A custom_rules.xml file was added for configuring ANT properly.
